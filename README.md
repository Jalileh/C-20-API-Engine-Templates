**C++20 nit picked source codes of various projects of mine**


fw-impl.h : part of a framework to provide high level interface for another set of components 

_engine-abs.h : callbacks implementation and storage that runs at the core level of my framework/engine, 
gives very neaty interaction with many parts of said project and nice looking code.
